NetApp storage controllers provide the storage foundation in the FlexPod architecture for both boot and application data storage. NetApp components include storage controllers, cluster interconnect switches, drives and disk shelves, and licensing options.

== NetApp storage controller options

Redundant NetApp FAS or AFF controllers are required in the FlexPod architecture. The controllers run ONTAP software. When the storage controllers are ordered, the preferred software version can be preloaded on the controllers. For ONTAP, a complete cluster is ordered. A complete cluster includes a pair of storage controllers and a cluster interconnect (switch or switchless).

Different options and configurations are available, depending on the selected storage platform. Consult your sales representative for details about these additional components.

The controller families that are listed in the table below are appropriate for use in a FlexPod Datacenter solution because their connection to the Cisco Nexus switches is seamless. See the https://hwu.netapp.com/[NetApp Hardware Universe^] for specific compatibility details on each controller model.

== Cluster interconnect switch options

The following table lists the NetApp and Cisco Nexus cluster interconnect switches that are available for FlexPod architectures. In addition, FlexPod supports all ONTAP supported cluster switches including non-Cisco switches, provided they are compatible with the version of ONTAP being deployed. See the https://hwu.netapp.com/[NetApp Hardware Universe^] for additional compatibility details for specific switch models.

== NetApp disk shelf and drive options

A minimum of one NetApp disk shelf is required for all storage controllers.

The selected NetApp shelf type determines which drive types are available within that shelf.

[NOTE]
For all disk shelves and disk part numbers, consult your sales representative.

For more information about the supported drives, click the NetApp Hardware Universe link in the following table and then select Supported Drives.

== NetApp support licensing options

NetApp SupportEdge Premium licenses are required for the FlexPod architecture, but the part numbers for those licenses vary based on the options that you select in the FlexPod design. For example, software license part numbers are different depending on which FAS controller you choose. Consult your sales representative for information about the exact part numbers for individual support licenses. The table below shows an example of a SupportEdge license.
