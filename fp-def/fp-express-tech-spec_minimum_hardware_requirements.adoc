This section describes the minimum hardware requirements for the different versions of FlexPod Express.

== FlexPod Express with NetApp FAS

The hardware requirements for FlexPod Express solutions that use NetApp FAS controllers for underlying storage include the configurations describe in this section.

=== CIMC-based configuration (standalone rack servers)

The Cisco Integrated Management Controller (CIMC) configuration includes the following hardware components:

* Two 10Gbps standard Ethernet switches in a redundant configuration (Cisco Nexus 0808 is recommended, with Cisco Nexus 3000 and 9000 models supported)
* Cisco UCS C-Series standalone rack servers
* Two AFF C190, AFF A220, FAS2600, or FAS 2700 series controllers in a high-availability (HA) pair configuration deployed as a two-node cluster

=== Cisco UCS-managed configuration

The Cisco UCS-managed confirmation includes the following hardware components:

* Two 10Gbps standard Ethernet switches in a redundant configuration (Cisco Nexus 3524 is recommended)
* One Cisco UCS 5108 alternating current (AC) blade server chassis
* Two Cisco UCS 6324 fabric interconnects
* Cisco UCS B-Series servers (at least four Cisco UCS B200 M5 blade servers)
* Two AFF C190, AFF A220, AFF A250, FAS2750, or FAS2720 controllers in an HA pair configuration (requires two available unified target adapter 2 [UTA2] ports per controller)

== FlexPod Express with E-Series

The hardware requirements for the FlexPod Express with E-Series starter configuration include:

* Two Cisco UCS 6324 fabric interconnects
* One Cisco UCS Mini chassis 5108 AC2 or DC2 (the Cisco UCS 6324 fabric interconnects are only supported in the AC2 and DC2 chassis)
* Cisco UCS B-Series servers (at least two Cisco UCS B200 M4 blade servers)
* One HA pair configuration of an E-Series E2824 storage system loaded with minimum 12 disk drives
* Two 10Gbps standard Ethernet switches in a redundant configuration (existing switches in the data center can be used)

These hardware components are required to build a starter configuration of the solution; additional blade servers and disk drives can be added as needed. The E-Series E2824 storage system can be replaced with a higher platform and can also be run as an all-flash system.
