This document provides details for configuring a fully redundant, highly available FlexPod Express system. To reflect this redundancy, the components being configured in each step are referred to as either component A or component B. For example, controller A and controller B identify the two NetApp storage controllers that are provisioned in this document. Switch A and switch B identify a pair of Cisco Nexus switches. Fabric Interconnect A and Fabric Interconnect B are the two Integrated Nexus Fabric Interconnects.

In addition, this document describes steps for provisioning multiple Cisco UCS hosts, which are identified sequentially as server A, server B, and so on.

To indicate that you should include information pertinent to your environment in a step, `\<<text>>` appears as part of the command structure. See the following example for the `vlan create` command:

....
Controller01>vlan create vif0 <<mgmt_vlan_id>>
....

This document enables you to fully configure the FlexPod Express environment. In this process, various steps require you to insert customer-specific naming conventions, IP addresses, and virtual local area network (VLAN) schemes. The table below describes the VLANs required for deployment, as outlined in this guide. This table can be completed based on the specific site variables and used to implement the document configuration steps.

[NOTE]
If you use separate in-band and out-of-band management VLANs, you must create a layer 3 route between them. For this validation, a common management VLAN was used.

== Cisco Nexus 31108PCV deployment procedure

This section details the Cisco Nexus 31308PCV switch configuration used in a FlexPod Express environment.

=== Initial setup of Cisco Nexus 31108PCV switch

This procedures describes how to configure the Cisco Nexus switches for use in a base FlexPod Express environment.

[NOTE]
This procedure assumes that you are using a Cisco Nexus 31108PCV running NX-OS software release 7.0(3)I6(1).

. Upon initial boot and connection to the console port of the switch, the Cisco NX-OS setup automatically starts. This initial configuration addresses basic settings, such as the switch name, the mgmt0 interface configuration, and Secure Shell (SSH) setup.
. The FlexPod Express management network can be configured in multiple ways. The mgmt0 interfaces on the 31108PCV switches can be connected to an existing management network, or the mgmt0 interfaces of the 31108PCV switches can be connected in a back-to-back configuration. However, this link cannot be used for external management access such as SSH traffic.
+
In this deployment guide, the FlexPod Express Cisco Nexus 31108PCV switches are connected to an existing management network.

. To configure the Cisco Nexus 31108PCV switches, power on the switch and follow the on-screen prompts, as illustrated here for the initial setup of both the switches, substituting the appropriate values for the switch-specific information.
+
....
This setup utility will guide you through the basic configuration of the system. Setup configures only enough connectivity for management of the system.
....
+
....
*Note: setup is mainly used for configuring the system initially, when no configuration is present. So setup always assumes system defaults and not the current system configuration values.

....

. You are then asked if you would like to use this configuration and save it. If so, enter `y`.
+
....
Use this configuration and save it? (yes/no) [y]: Enter
....

. Repeat steps 1 through 5 for Cisco Nexus switch B.

=== Enable advanced features

Certain advanced features must be enabled in Cisco NX-OS to provide additional configuration options.

. To enable the appropriate features on Cisco Nexus switch A and switch B, enter configuration mode by using the command `(config t)` and run the following commands:
+
....
feature interface-vlan
feature lacp
feature vpc
....
+
[NOTE]
The default port channel load-balancing hash uses the source and destination IP addresses to determine the load-balancing algorithm across the interfaces in the port channel. You can achieve better distribution across the members of the port channel by providing more inputs to the hash algorithm beyond the source and destination IP addresses. For the same reason, NetApp highly recommends adding the source and destination TCP ports to the hash algorithm.

. From configuration mode `(config t)`, run the following commands to set the global port channel load-balancing configuration on Cisco Nexus switch A and switch B:
+
....
port-channel load-balance src-dst ip-l4port
....

=== Perform global spanning-tree configuration

The Cisco Nexus platform uses a new protection feature called bridge assurance. Bridge assurance helps protect against a unidirectional link or other software failure with a device that continues to forward data traffic when it is no longer running the spanning-tree algorithm. Ports can be placed in one of several states, including network or edge, depending on the platform.

NetApp recommends setting bridge assurance so that all ports are considered to be network ports by default. This setting forces the network administrator to review the configuration of each port. It also reveals the most common configuration errors, such as unidentified edge ports or a neighbor that does not have the bridge assurance feature enabled. In addition, it is safer to have the spanning tree block many ports rather than too few, which allows the default port state to enhance the overall stability of the network.

Pay close attention to the spanning-tree state when adding servers, storage, and uplink switches, especially if they do not support bridge assurance. In such cases, you might need to change the port type to make the ports active.

The Bridge Protocol Data Unit (BPDU) guard is enabled on edge ports by default as another layer of protection. To prevent loops in the network, this feature shuts down the port if BPDUs from another switch are seen on this interface.

From configuration mode (`config t`), run the following commands to configure the default spanning-tree options, including the default port type and BPDU guard, on Cisco Nexus switch A and switch B:

....
spanning-tree port type network default
spanning-tree port type edge bpduguard default
....

=== Define VLANs

Before individual ports with different VLANs are configured, the layer-2 VLANs must be defined on the switch. It is also a good practice to name the VLANs for easy troubleshooting in the future.

From configuration mode (`config t`), run the following commands to define and describe the layer 2 VLANs on Cisco Nexus switch A and switch B:

....
vlan <<nfs_vlan_id>>
  name NFS-VLAN
vlan <<iSCSI_A_vlan_id>>
  name iSCSI-A-VLAN
vlan <<iSCSI_B_vlan_id>>
  name iSCSI-B-VLAN
vlan <<vmotion_vlan_id>>
  name vMotion-VLAN
vlan <<vmtraffic_vlan_id>>
  name VM-Traffic-VLAN
vlan <<mgmt_vlan_id>>
  name MGMT-VLAN
vlan <<native_vlan_id>>
  name NATIVE-VLAN
exit
....

=== Configure access and management port descriptions

As is the case with assigning names to the layer-2 VLANs, setting descriptions for all the interfaces can help with both provisioning and troubleshooting.

From configuration mode (`config t`) in each of the switches, enter the following port descriptions for the FlexPod Express large configuration:

==== Cisco Nexus switch A

....
int eth1/1
  description AFF A220-A e0M
int eth1/2
  description Cisco UCS FI-A mgmt0
int eth1/3
  description Cisco UCS FI-A eth1/1
int eth1/4
  description Cisco UCS FI-B eth1/1
int eth1/13
  description vPC peer-link 31108PVC-B 1/13
int eth1/14
  description vPC peer-link 31108PVC-B 1/14
....

==== Cisco Nexus switch B

....
int eth1/1
  description AFF A220-B e0M
int eth1/2
  description Cisco UCS FI-B mgmt0
int eth1/3
  description Cisco UCS FI-A eth1/2
int eth1/4
  description Cisco UCS FI-B eth1/2
int eth1/13
  description vPC peer-link 31108PVC-B 1/13
int eth1/14
  description vPC peer-link 31108PVC-B 1/14
....

=== Configure server and storage management interfaces

The management interfaces for both the server and the storage typically use only a single VLAN. Therefore, configure the management interface ports as access ports. Define the management VLAN for each switch and change the spanning-tree port type to edge.

From configuration mode (`config t`), run the following commands to configure the port settings for the management interfaces of both the servers and the storage:

==== Cisco Nexus switch A

....
int eth1/1-2
  switchport mode access
  switchport access vlan <<mgmt_vlan>>
  spanning-tree port type edge
  speed 1000
exit
....

==== Cisco Nexus switch B

....
int eth1/1-2
  switchport mode access
  switchport access vlan <<mgmt_vlan>>
  spanning-tree port type edge
  speed 1000
exit
....

=== Add NTP distribution interface

==== Cisco Nexus switch A

From the global configuration mode, execute the following commands.

....
interface Vlan<ib-mgmt-vlan-id>
ip address <switch-a-ntp-ip>/<ib-mgmt-vlan-netmask-length>
no shutdown
exitntp peer <switch-b-ntp-ip> use-vrf default
....

==== Cisco Nexus switch B

From the global configuration mode, execute the following commands.

....
interface Vlan<ib-mgmt-vlan-id>
ip address <switch- b-ntp-ip>/<ib-mgmt-vlan-netmask-length>
no shutdown
exitntp peer <switch-a-ntp-ip> use-vrf default
....

=== Perform virtual port channel global configuration

A virtual port channel (vPC) enables links that are physically connected to two different Cisco Nexus switches to appear as a single port channel to a third device. The third device can be a switch, server, or any other networking device. A vPC can provide layer-2 multipathing, which allows you to create redundancy by increasing bandwidth, enabling multiple parallel paths between nodes, and load-balancing traffic where alternative paths exist.

A vPC provides the following benefits:

* Enabling a single device to use a port channel across two upstream devices
* Eliminating spanning-tree protocol blocked ports
* Providing a loop-free topology
* Using all available uplink bandwidth
* Providing fast convergence if either the link or a device fails
* Providing link-level resiliency
* Helping provide high availability

The vPC feature requires some initial setup between the two Cisco Nexus switches to function properly. If you use the back-to-back mgmt0 configuration, use the addresses defined on the interfaces and verify that they can communicate by using the ping `\<<switch_A/B_mgmt0_ip_addr>>vrf` management command.

From configuration mode (`config t`), run the following commands to configure the vPC global configuration for both switches:

==== Cisco Nexus switch A

[NOTE]
In this solution validation, a maximum transmission unit (MTU) of 9000 was used. However, based on application requirements, you can configure an appropriate value of MTU. It is important to set the same MTU value across the FlexPod solution. Incorrect MTU configurations between components result in packets being dropped.

=== Uplink into existing network infrastructure

Depending on the available network infrastructure, several methods and features can be used to uplink the FlexPod environment. If an existing Cisco Nexus environment is present, NetApp recommends using vPCs to uplink the Cisco Nexus 31108PVC switches included in the FlexPod environment into the infrastructure. The uplinks can be 10GbE uplinks for a 10GbE infrastructure solution or 1GbE for a 1GbE infrastructure solution if required. The previously described procedures can be used to create an uplink vPC to the existing environment. Make sure to run copy run start to save the configuration on each switch after the configuration is completed.

== NetApp storage deployment procedure (part 1)

This section describes the NetApp AFF storage deployment procedure.

. Verify that the current mode of the ports that are in use is `cna` and that the current type is set to `target`. If not, change the port personality by running the following command:
+
....
ucadmin modify -node <home node of the port> -adapter <port name> -mode cna -type target
....
+
The ports must be offline to run the previous command. To take a port offline, run the following command:
+
....
network fcp adapter modify -node <home node of the port> -adapter <port name> -state down
....
+
[NOTE]
If you changed the port personality, you must reboot each node for the change to take effect.

....

[NOTE]
The service processor IP addresses should be in the same subnet as the node management IP addresses.

==== Enable storage failover in ONTAP

To confirm that storage failover is enabled, run the following commands in a failover pair:

. Verify the status of storage failover.
+
....
storage failover show
....
+
Both `\<<var_nodeA>>` and `\<<var_nodeB>>` must be able to perform a takeover. Go to step 3 if the nodes can perform a takeover.

. Enable failover on one of the two nodes.
+
....
storage failover modify -node <<var_nodeA>> -enabled true
....

. Verify the HA status of the two-node cluster.
+
[NOTE]
This step is not applicable for clusters with more than two nodes.
+
....
cluster ha show

. Go to step 6 if high availability is configured. If high availability is configured, you see the following message upon issuing the command:
+
....
High Availability Configured: true
....

. Enable HA mode only for the two-node cluster.
+
Do not run this command for clusters with more than two nodes because it causes problems with failover.
+
....
cluster ha modify -configured true
Do you want to continue? {y|n}: y
....

. Verify that hardware assist is correctly configured and, if needed, modify the partner IP address.
+
....
storage failover hwassist show
....
+

network port vlan create –node <<var_nodeA>> -vlan-name e0m-<<mgmt_vlan_id>>
network port vlan create –node <<var_nodeB>> -vlan-name e0m-<<mgmt_vlan_id>>
....

==== Create aggregates in ONTAP

An aggregate containing the root volume is created during the ONTAP setup process. To create additional aggregates, determine the aggregate name, the node on which to create it, and the number of disks it contains.

To create aggregates, run the following commands:

....
aggr create -aggregate aggr1_nodeA -node <<var_nodeA>> -diskcount <<var_num_disks>>
aggr create -aggregate aggr1_nodeB -node <<var_nodeB>> -diskcount <<var_num_disks>>
....

Retain at least one disk (select the largest disk) in the configuration as a spare. A best practice is to have at least one spare for each disk type and size.

Start with five disks; you can add disks to an aggregate when additional storage is required.

The aggregate cannot be created until disk zeroing completes. Run the `aggr show` command to display the aggregate creation status. Do not proceed until `aggr1_nodeA` is online.

==== Configure time zone in ONTAP

To configure time synchronization and to set the time zone on the cluster, run the following command:

....
timezone <<var_timezone>>
....

[NOTE]
For example, in the eastern United States, the time zone is `America/New_York`. After you begin typing the time zone name, press the Tab key to see available options.

==== Configure SNMP in ONTAP

To configure the SNMP, complete the following steps:

. Configure SNMP basic information, such as the location and contact. When polled, this information is visible as the `sysLocation` and `sysContact` variables in SNMP.
+
....
snmp contact <<var_snmp_contact>>
snmp location “<<var_snmp_location>>”
snmp init 1
options snmp.enable on
....

. Configure SNMP traps to send to remote hosts.
+
....
snmp traphost add <<var_snmp_server_fqdn>>
....

==== Configure SNMPv1 in ONTAP

To configure SNMPv1, set the shared secret plain-text password called a community.

....
snmp community add ro <<var_snmp_community>>
....

[NOTE]
Use the `snmp community delete all` command with caution. If community strings are used for other monitoring products, this command removes them.

==== Configure SNMPv3 in ONTAP

SNMPv3 requires that you define and configure a user for authentication. To configure SNMPv3, complete the following steps:

. Run the `security snmpusers` command to view the engine ID.
. Create a user called `snmpv3user`.
+
....
security login create -username snmpv3user -authmethod usm -application snmp
....

. Enter the authoritative entity's engine ID and select `md5` as the authentication protocol.
. Enter an eight-character minimum-length password for the authentication protocol when prompted.
. Select `des` as the privacy protocol.
. Enter an eight-character minimum-length password for the privacy protocol when prompted.

==== Configure AutoSupport HTTPS in ONTAP

The NetApp AutoSupport tool sends support summary information to NetApp through HTTPS. To configure AutoSupport, run the following command:

....
system node autosupport modify -node * -state enable –mail-hosts <<var_mailhost>> -transport https -support enable -noteto <<var_storage_admin_email>>
....

==== Create a storage virtual machine

To create an infrastructure storage virtual machine (SVM), complete the following steps:

. Run the `vserver create` command.
+
....
vserver create –vserver Infra-SVM –rootvolume rootvol –aggregate aggr1_nodeA –rootvolume- security-style unix
....

. Add the data aggregate to the infra-SVM aggregate list for the NetApp VSC.
+
....
vserver modify -vserver Infra-SVM -aggr-list aggr1_nodeA,aggr1_nodeB
....

. Remove the unused storage protocols from the SVM, leaving NFS and iSCSI.
+
....
vserver remove-protocols –vserver Infra-SVM -protocols cifs,ndmp,fcp
....

. Enable and run the NFS protocol in the infra-SVM SVM.
+
....
nfs create -vserver Infra-SVM -udp disabled
....

. Turn on the `SVM vstorage` parameter for the NetApp NFS VAAI plug-in. Then, verify that NFS has been configured.
+
....
vserver nfs modify –vserver Infra-SVM –vstorage enabled
vserver nfs show
....
+
[NOTE]
Commands are prefaced by `vserver` in the command line because SVMs were previously called servers

==== Configure NFSv3 in ONTAP

The table below lists the information needed to complete this configuration.

|===
|Detail |Detail Value

|ESXi host A NFS IP address
|\<<var_esxi_hostA_nfs_ip>>

|ESXi host B NFS IP address
|\<<var_esxi_hostB_nfs_ip>>

|===

To configure NFS on the SVM, run the following commands:

. Create a rule for each ESXi host in the default export policy.
. For each ESXi host being created, assign a rule. Each host has its own rule index. Your first ESXi host has rule index 1, your second ESXi host has rule index 2, and so on.
+
....
vserver export-policy rule create –vserver Infra-SVM -policyname default –ruleindex 1 –protocol nfs -clientmatch <<var_esxi_hostA_nfs_ip>> -rorule sys –rwrule sys -superuser sys –allow-suid falsevserver export-policy rule create –vserver Infra-SVM -policyname default –ruleindex 2 –protocol nfs -clientmatch <<var_esxi_hostB_nfs_ip>> -rorule sys –rwrule sys -superuser sys –allow-suid false
vserver export-policy rule show
....

. Assign the export policy to the infrastructure SVM root volume.
+
....
volume modify –vserver Infra-SVM –volume rootvol –policy default
....
+
[NOTE]
The NetApp VSC automatically handles export policies if you choose to install it after vSphere has been set up. If you do not install it, you must create export policy rules when additional Cisco UCS B-Series servers are added.

==== Create iSCSI service in ONTAP

To create the iSCSI service, complete the following step:

. Create the iSCSI service on the SVM. This command also starts the iSCSI service and sets the iSCSI Qualified Name (IQN) for the SVM. Verify that iSCSI has been configured.
+
....
iscsi create -vserver Infra-SVM
iscsi show
....

==== Create load-sharing mirror of SVM root volume in ONTAP

To create a load-sharing mirror of the SVM root volume in ONTAP, complete the following steps:

. Create a volume to be the load-sharing mirror of the infrastructure SVM root volume on each node.
+
....
volume create –vserver Infra_Vserver –volume rootvol_m01 –aggregate aggr1_nodeA –size 1GB –type DPvolume create –vserver Infra_Vserver –volume rootvol_m02 –aggregate aggr1_nodeB –size 1GB –type DP
....

. Create a job schedule to update the root volume mirror relationships every 15 minutes.
+
....
job schedule interval create -name 15min -minutes 15
....

. Create the mirroring relationships.
+
....
snapmirror create -source-path Infra-SVM:rootvol -destination-path Infra-SVM:rootvol_m01 -type LS -schedule 15min
snapmirror create -source-path Infra-SVM:rootvol -destination-path Infra-SVM:rootvol_m02 -type LS -schedule 15min
....

. Initialize the mirroring relationship and verify that it has been created.
+
....
snapmirror initialize-ls-set -source-path Infra-SVM:rootvol snapmirror show
....

==== Configure HTTPS access in ONTAP

To configure secure access to the storage controller, complete the following steps:

. Increase the privilege level to access the certificate commands.
+
....
set -privilege diag
Do you want to continue? {y|n}: y
....

. Generally, a self-signed certificate is already in place. Verify the certificate by running the following command:
+
....
security certificate show
....

. For each SVM shown, the certificate common name should match the DNS fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the SVM. The four default certificates should be deleted and replaced by either self-signed certificates or certificates from a certificate authority.
+
Deleting expired certificates before creating certificates is a best practice. Run the `security certificate delete` command to delete expired certificates. In the following command, use TAB completion to select and delete each default certificate.
+
....
security certificate delete [TAB] ...
Example: security certificate delete -vserver Infra-SVM -common-name Infra-SVM -ca Infra-SVM - type server -serial 552429A6
....

. To generate and install self-signed certificates, run the following commands as one-time commands. Generate a server certificate for the infra-SVM and the cluster SVM. Again, use TAB completion to aid in completing these commands.
+
....
security certificate create [TAB] ...
Example: security certificate create -common-name infra-svm.netapp.com -type server -size 2048 - country US -state "North Carolina" -locality "RTP" -organization "NetApp" -unit "FlexPod" -email- addr "abc@netapp.com" -expire-days 365 -protocol SSL -hash-function SHA256 -vserver Infra-SVM
....

. To obtain the values for the parameters required in the following step, run the `security certificate show` command.
. Enable each certificate that was just created using the `–server-enabled true` and `–client- enabled false` parameters. Again, use TAB completion.
+
....
security ssl modify [TAB] ...
Example: security ssl modify -vserver Infra-SVM -server-enabled true -client-enabled false -ca infra-svm.netapp.com -serial 55243646 -common-name infra-svm.netapp.com
....

. Configure and enable SSL and HTTPS access and disable HTTP access.
+
....
system services web modify -external true -sslv3-enabled true
Warning: Modifying the cluster configuration will cause pending web service requests to be interrupted as the web servers are restarted.
Do you want to continue {y|n}: y
System services firewall policy delete -policy mgmt -service http -vserver <<var_clustername>>
....
+
[NOTE]
It is normal for some of these commands to return an error message stating that the entry does not exist.

. Revert to the admin privilege level and create the setup to allow SVM to be available by the web.
+
....
set –privilege admin
vserver services web modify –name spi|ontapi|compat –vserver * -enabled true
....

==== Create a NetApp FlexVol volume in ONTAP

To create a NetApp FlexVol® volume, enter the volume name, size, and the aggregate on which it exists. Create two VMware datastore volumes and a server boot volume.

....
volume create -vserver Infra-SVM -volume infra_datastore_1 -aggregate aggr1_nodeA -size 500GB - state online -policy default -junction-path /infra_datastore_1 -space-guarantee none -percent- snapshot-space 0
volume create -vserver Infra-SVM -volume infra_datastore_2 -aggregate aggr1_nodeB -size 500GB - state online -policy default -junction-path /infra_datastore_2 -space-guarantee none -percent- snapshot-space 0
....

....
volume create -vserver Infra-SVM -volume infra_swap -aggregate aggr1_nodeA -size 100GB -state online -policy default -juntion-path /infra_swap -space-guarantee none -percent-snapshot-space 0 -snapshot-policy none
volume create -vserver Infra-SVM -volume esxi_boot -aggregate aggr1_nodeA -size 100GB -state online -policy default -space-guarantee none -percent-snapshot-space 0
....

==== Enable deduplication in ONTAP

To enable deduplication on appropriate volumes once a day, run the following commands:

....
volume efficiency modify –vserver Infra-SVM –volume esxi_boot –schedule sun-sat@0
volume efficiency modify –vserver Infra-SVM –volume infra_datastore_1 –schedule sun-sat@0
volume efficiency modify –vserver Infra-SVM –volume infra_datastore_2 –schedule sun-sat@0
....

==== Create LUNs in ONTAP

To create two boot logical unit numbers (LUNs), run the following commands:

....
lun create -vserver Infra-SVM -volume esxi_boot -lun VM-Host-Infra-A -size 15GB -ostype vmware - space-reserve disabled
lun create -vserver Infra-SVM -volume esxi_boot -lun VM-Host-Infra-B -size 15GB -ostype vmware - space-reserve disabled
....

[NOTE]
When adding an extra Cisco UCS C-Series server, an extra boot LUN must be created.

By default, the MAC address of the management VMkernel port vmk0 is the same as the MAC address of the Ethernet port on which it is placed. If the ESXi host’s boot LUN is remapped to a different server with different MAC addresses, a MAC address conflict will occur because vmk0 retains the assigned MAC address unless the ESXi system configuration is reset. To reset the MAC address of vmk0 to a random VMware-assigned MAC address, complete the following steps:

. From the ESXi console menu main screen, press Ctrl-Alt-F1 to access the VMware console command line interface. In the UCSM KVM, Ctrl-Alt-F1 appears in the list of static macros.
. Log in as root.
. Type `esxcfg-vmknic –l` to get a detailed listing of interface vmk0. vmk0 should be a part of the Management Network port group. Note the IP address and netmask of vmk0.
. To remove vmk0, enter the following command:
+
....
esxcfg-vmknic –d “Management Network”
....

. To add vmk0 again with a random MAC address, enter the following command:
+
....
esxcfg-vmknic –a –i <vmk0-ip> -n <vmk0-netmask> “Management Network””.
....

. Verify that vmk0 has been added again with a random MAC address
+
....
esxcfg-vmknic –l
....

. Type `exit` to log out of the command line interface.
. Press Ctrl-Alt-F2 to return to the ESXi console menu interface.
