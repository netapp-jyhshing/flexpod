== Set up ONTAP SAN boot storage

=== Create iSCSI igroups

[NOTE]
You need the iSCSI initiator IQNs from the server configuration for this step.

To create igroups, run the following commands from the cluster management node SSH connection. To view the three igroups created in this step, run the `igroup show` command.

....
igroup create –vserver Infra-SVM –igroup VM-Host-Infra-A –protocol iscsi –ostype vmware –initiator <<var_vm_host_infra_a_iSCSI-A_vNIC_IQN>>,<<var_vm_host_infra_a_iSCSI-B_vNIC_IQN>>
igroup create –vserver Infra-SVM –igroup VM-Host-Infra-B –protocol iscsi –ostype vmware –initiator <<var_vm_host_infra_b_iSCSI-A_vNIC_IQN>>,<<var_vm_host_infra_b_iSCSI-B_vNIC_IQN>>
....

[NOTE]
This step must be completed when adding additional Cisco UCS C-Series servers.

== Map boot LUNs to igroups

....
To map boot LUNs to igroups, run the following commands from the cluster management SSH connection:
lun map –vserver Infra-SVM –volume esxi_boot –lun VM-Host-Infra-A –igroup VM-Host-Infra-A –lun-id 0
lun map –vserver Infra-SVM –volume esxi_boot –lun VM-Host-Infra-B –igroup VM-Host-Infra-B –lun-id 0
....

[NOTE]
This step must be completed when adding additional Cisco UCS C-Series servers.
