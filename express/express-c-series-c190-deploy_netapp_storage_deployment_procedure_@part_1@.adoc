This section describes the NetApp AFF storage deployment procedure.

== NetApp storage controller AFF C190 Series installation

=== NetApp Hardware Universe

The NetApp Hardware Universe (HWU) application provides supported hardware and software components for any specific ONTAP version. It provides configuration information for all the NetApp storage appliances currently supported by ONTAP software. It also provides a table of component compatibilities.

Confirm that the hardware and software components that you would like to use are supported with the version of ONTAP that you plan to install:

Access the http://hwu.netapp.com/Home/Index[HWU^] application to view the system configuration guides. Click the Controllers tab to view the compatibility between different version of the ONTAP software and the NetApp storage appliances with your desired specifications.

Alternatively, to compare components by storage appliance, click Compare Storage Systems.

AFF C190_B     0f       cna       target     -        -          online
8 entries were displayed.
....

. Verify that the current mode of the ports that are in use is cna and that the current type is set to target. If not, change the port personality by using the following command:
+
....
ucadmin modify -node <home node of the port> -adapter <port name> -mode cna -type target
....
+
[NOTE]
The ports must be offline to run the previous command. To take a port offline, run the following command:
+
....
network fcp adapter modify -node <home node of the port> -adapter <port name> -state down
....
+
[NOTE]
If you changed the port personality, you must reboot each node for the change to take effect.

== Rename the management logical interfaces

To rename the management logical interfaces (LIFs), complete the following steps:

. Show the current management LIF names.
+
....
network interface show –vserver <<clustername>>
....

. Rename the cluster management LIF.
+
....
network interface rename –vserver <<clustername>> –lif cluster_setup_cluster_mgmt_lif_1 –newname cluster_mgmt
....

. Rename the node B management LIF.
+
....
network interface rename -vserver <<clustername>> -lif cluster_setup_node_mgmt_lif_AFF C190_B_1 -newname AFF C190-02_mgmt1
....

== Set auto-revert on cluster management

Set the auto-revert parameter on the cluster management interface.

....
network interface modify –vserver <<clustername>> -lif cluster_mgmt –auto-revert true
....

== Set up the service processor network interface

To assign a static IPv4 address to the service processor on each node, run the following commands:

....
system service-processor network modify –node <<var_nodeA>> -address-family IPv4 –enable true –dhcp none –ip-address <<var_nodeA_sp_ip>> -netmask <<var_nodeA_sp_mask>> -gateway <<var_nodeA_sp_gateway>>
system service-processor network modify –node <<var_nodeB>> -address-family IPv4 –enable true –dhcp none –ip-address <<var_nodeB_sp_ip>> -netmask <<var_nodeB_sp_mask>> -gateway <<var_nodeB_sp_gateway>>
....

[NOTE]
The service processor IP addresses should be in the same subnet as the node management IP addresses.

== Enable storage failover in ONTAP

To confirm that storage failover is enabled, run the following commands in a failover pair:

. Verify the status of storage failover.
+
....
storage failover show
....
+
[NOTE]
Both `\<<var_nodeA>>` and `\<<var_nodeB>>` must be able to perform a takeover. Go to step 3 if the nodes can perform a takeover.

. Enable failover on one of the two nodes.
+
....
storage failover modify -node <<var_nodeA>> -enabled true
....
+
[NOTE]
Enabling failover on one node enables it for both nodes.

. Verify the HA status of the two-node cluster.
+
[NOTE]
This step is not applicable for clusters with more than two nodes.
+
....
cluster ha show
....

. Go to step 6 if high availability is configured. If high availability is configured, you see the following message upon issuing the command:
+
....
High Availability Configured: true
....

. Enable HA mode only for the two-node cluster.
+
[NOTE]
Do not run this command for clusters with more than two nodes because it causes problems with failover.
+
....
cluster ha modify -configured true
Do you want to continue? {y|n}: y
....

. Verify that hardware assist is correctly configured and, if needed, modify the partner IP address.
+
....
storage failover hwassist show
....
+
[NOTE]
The message `Keep Alive Status: Error:` indicates that one of the controllers did not receive hwassist keep alive alerts from its partner, indicating that hardware assist is not configured. Run the following commands to configure hardware assist.
+
....
storage failover modify –hwassist-partner-ip <<var_nodeB_mgmt_ip>> -node <<var_nodeA>>
storage failover modify –hwassist-partner-ip <<var_nodeA_mgmt_ip>> -node <<var_nodeB>>

....
network port vlan create –node <<var_nodeA>> -vlan-name a0a-<<mgmt_vlan_id>>
network port vlan create –node <<var_nodeB>> -vlan-name a0a-<<mgmt_vlan_id>>
....

== Create data aggregates in ONTAP

An aggregate containing the root volume is created during the ONTAP setup process. To create additional aggregates, determine the aggregate name, the node on which to create it, and the number of disks it contains.

To create aggregates, run the following commands:

....
aggr create -aggregate aggr1_nodeA -node <<var_nodeA>> -diskcount <<var_num_disks>>
aggr create -aggregate aggr1_nodeB -node <<var_nodeB>> -diskcount <<var_num_disks>>
....

[NOTE]
Retain at least one disk (select the largest disk) in the configuration as a spare. A best practice is to have at least one spare for each disk type and size.

[NOTE]
Start with five disks; you can add disks to an aggregate when additional storage is required.

[NOTE]
The aggregate cannot be created until disk zeroing completes. Run the `aggr show` command to display the aggregate creation status. Do not proceed until aggr1_nodeA is online.

== Configure Time Zone in ONTAP

To configure time synchronization and to set the time zone on the cluster, run the following command:

....
timezone <<var_timezone>>
....

[NOTE]
For example, in the eastern United States, the time zone is America/New_York. After you begin typing the time zone name, press the Tab key to see available options.

== Configure SNMP in ONTAP

To configure the SNMP, complete the following steps:

. Configure SNMP basic information, such as the location and contact. When polled, this information is visible as the `sysLocation` and `sysContact` variables in SNMP.
+
....
snmp contact <<var_snmp_contact>>
snmp location “<<var_snmp_location>>”
snmp init 1
options snmp.enable on
....

. Configure SNMP traps to send to remote hosts.
+
....
snmp traphost add <<var_snmp_server_fqdn>>
....

== Configure SNMPv1 in ONTAP

To configure SNMPv1, set the shared secret plain-text password called a community.

....
snmp community add ro <<var_snmp_community>>
....

[NOTE]
Use the `snmp community delete all` command with caution. If community strings are used for other monitoring products, this command removes them.

== Configure SNMPv3 in ONTAP

SNMPv3 requires that you define and configure a user for authentication. To configure SNMPv3, complete the following steps:

. Run the `security snmpusers` command to view the engine ID.
. Create a user called `snmpv3user`.
+
....
security login create -username snmpv3user -authmethod usm -application snmp
....

. Enter the authoritative entity's engine ID and select md5 as the authentication protocol.
. Enter an eight-character minimum-length password for the authentication protocol when prompted.
. Select des as the privacy protocol.
. Enter an eight-character minimum-length password for the privacy protocol when prompted.

== Configure AutoSupport HTTPS in ONTAP

The NetApp AutoSupport tool sends support summary information to NetApp through HTTPS. To configure AutoSupport, run the following command:

....
system node autosupport modify -node * -state enable –mail-hosts <<var_mailhost>> -transport https -support enable -noteto <<var_storage_admin_email>>
....

== Create a storage virtual machine

To create an infrastructure storage virtual machine (SVM), complete the following steps:

. Run the `vserver create` command.
+
....
vserver create –vserver Infra-SVM –rootvolume rootvol –aggregate aggr1_nodeA –rootvolume-security-style unix
....

. Add the data aggregate to the infra-SVM aggregate list for the NetApp VSC.
+
....
vserver modify -vserver Infra-SVM -aggr-list aggr1_nodeA,aggr1_nodeB
....

. Remove the unused storage protocols from the SVM, leaving NFS and iSCSI.
+
....
vserver remove-protocols –vserver Infra-SVM -protocols cifs,ndmp,fcp
....

. Enable and run the NFS protocol in the infra-SVM SVM.
+
....
nfs create -vserver Infra-SVM -udp disabled
....

. Turn on the `SVM vstorage` parameter for the NetApp NFS VAAI plug-in. Then, verify that NFS has been configured.
+
....
vserver nfs modify –vserver Infra-SVM –vstorage enabled
vserver nfs show
....
+
[NOTE]
Commands are prefaced by `vserver` in the command line because SVMs were previously called Vservers.

== Configure NFSv3 in ONTAP

The following table lists the information needed to complete this configuration.

|===
|Detail |Detail value

|ESXi host A NFS IP address
|\<<var_esxi_hostA_nfs_ip>>
|ESXi host B NFS IP address
|\<<var_esxi_hostB_nfs_ip>>
|===

To configure NFS on the SVM, run the following commands:

. Create a rule for each ESXi host in the default export policy.
. For each ESXi host being created, assign a rule. Each host has its own rule index. Your first ESXi host has rule index 1, your second ESXi host has rule index 2, and so on.
+

. Assign the export policy to the infrastructure SVM root volume.
+
....
volume modify –vserver Infra-SVM –volume rootvol –policy default
....
+
[NOTE]
The NetApp VSC automatically handles export policies if you choose to install it after vSphere has been set up. If you do not install it, you must create export policy rules when additional Cisco UCS C-Series servers are added.

== Create the iSCSI service in ONTAP

To create the iSCSI service on the SVM, run the following command. This command also starts the iSCSI service and sets the iSCSI IQN for the SVM. Verify that iSCSI has been configured.

....
iscsi create -vserver Infra-SVM
iscsi show
....

== Create load-sharing mirror of SVM root volume in ONTAP

To create a load-sharing mirror of the SVM root volume in ONTAP, complete the following steps:

. Create a volume to be the load-sharing mirror of the infrastructure SVM root volume on each node.
+
....
volume create –vserver Infra_Vserver –volume rootvol_m01 –aggregate aggr1_nodeA –size 1GB –type DP
volume create –vserver Infra_Vserver –volume rootvol_m02 –aggregate aggr1_nodeB –size 1GB –type DP
....

. Create a job schedule to update the root volume mirror relationships every 15 minutes.
+
....
job schedule interval create -name 15min -minutes 15
....

. Create the mirroring relationships.
+
....
snapmirror create -source-path Infra-SVM:rootvol -destination-path Infra-SVM:rootvol_m01 -type LS -schedule 15min
snapmirror create -source-path Infra-SVM:rootvol -destination-path Infra-SVM:rootvol_m02 -type LS -schedule 15min
....

. Initialize the mirroring relationship and verify that it has been created.
+
....
snapmirror initialize-ls-set -source-path Infra-SVM:rootvol
snapmirror show
....

== Configure HTTPS access in ONTAP

To configure secure access to the storage controller, complete the following steps:

. Increase the privilege level to access the certificate commands.
+
....
set -privilege diag
Do you want to continue? {y|n}: y
....

. Generally, a self-signed certificate is already in place. Verify the certificate by running the following command:
+
....
security certificate show
....

. For each SVM shown, the certificate common name should match the DNS FQDN of the SVM. The four default certificates should be deleted and replaced by either self-signed certificates or certificates from a certificate authority.
+
[NOTE]
Deleting expired certificates before creating certificates is a best practice. Run the `security certificate delete` command to delete expired certificates. In the following command, use TAB completion to select and delete each default certificate.
+
....
security certificate delete [TAB] …
Example: security certificate delete -vserver Infra-SVM -common-name Infra-SVM -ca Infra-SVM -type server -serial 552429A6
....

. To generate and install self-signed certificates, run the following commands as one-time commands. Generate a server certificate for the infra-SVM and the cluster SVM. Again, use TAB completion to aid in completing these commands.
+
....
security certificate create [TAB] …
Example: security certificate create -common-name infra-svm.netapp.com -type server -size 2048 -country US -state "North Carolina" -locality "RTP" -organization "NetApp" -unit "FlexPod" -email-addr "abc@netapp.com" -expire-days 3650 -protocol SSL -hash-function SHA256 -vserver Infra-SVM
....

. To obtain the values for the parameters required in the following step, run the security certificate show command.
. Enable each certificate that was just created using the `–server-enabled true` and `–client-enabled false` parameters. Again, use TAB completion.
+
....
security ssl modify [TAB] …
Example: security ssl modify -vserver Infra-SVM -server-enabled true -client-enabled false -ca infra-svm.netapp.com -serial 55243646 -common-name infra-svm.netapp.com
....

. Configure and enable SSL and HTTPS access and disable HTTP access.
+
....
system services web modify -external true -sslv3-enabled true
Warning: Modifying the cluster configuration will cause pending web service requests to be interrupted as the web servers are restarted.
Do you want to continue {y|n}: y
system services firewall policy delete -policy mgmt -service http –vserver <<var_clustername>>
....
+
[NOTE]
It is normal for some of these commands to return an error message stating that the entry does not exist.

. Revert to the admin privilege level and create the setup to allow the SVM to be available by the web.
+
....
set –privilege admin
vserver services web modify –name spi –vserver * -enabled true
....

== Create a NetApp FlexVol volume in ONTAP

To create a NetApp FlexVol® volume, enter the volume name, size, and the aggregate on which it exists. Create two VMware datastore volumes and a server boot volume.

....
volume create -vserver Infra-SVM -volume infra_datastore -aggregate aggr1_nodeB -size 500GB -state online -policy default -junction-path /infra_datastore -space-guarantee none -percent-snapshot-space 0
volume create -vserver Infra-SVM -volume infra_swap -aggregate aggr1_nodeA -size 100GB -state online -policy default -junction-path /infra_swap -space-guarantee none -percent-snapshot-space 0 -snapshot-policy none -efficiency-policy none
volume create -vserver Infra-SVM -volume esxi_boot -aggregate aggr1_nodeA -size 100GB -state online -policy default -space-guarantee none -percent-snapshot-space 0
....

== Create LUNs in ONTAP

To create two boot LUNs, run the following commands:

....
lun create -vserver Infra-SVM -volume esxi_boot -lun VM-Host-Infra-A -size 15GB -ostype vmware -space-reserve disabled
lun create -vserver Infra-SVM -volume esxi_boot -lun VM-Host-Infra-B -size 15GB -ostype vmware -space-reserve disabled
....

[NOTE]
When adding an extra Cisco UCS C-Series server, you must create an extra boot LUN.
