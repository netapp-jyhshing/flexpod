This section discusses a sample Bill of Materials for different size storage architectures.

== Bill of material for small, medium, and large architectures.

The FlexPod design is a flexible infrastructure that encompasses many different components and software versions. Use https://fieldportal.netapp.com/content/443847[TR-4036: FlexPod Technical Specifications^] as a guide to assembling a valid FlexPod configuration. The configurations in the table below are the minimum requirements for FlexPod, and are just a sample. The configuration can be expanded for each product family as required for different environments and use cases.

For this sizing exercise small corresponds to a Category 3 MEDITECH environment, medium to a Category 5, and large to a Category 6.

[NOTE]
Some customer environments might have multiple MEDITECH production workloads running simultaneously or might have higher IOPS requirements. In such cases, work with the NetApp account team to size the storage systems according to the required IOPS and capacity. You should be able to determine the right platform to serve the workloads. For example, there are customers successfully running multiple MEDITECH environments on a NetApp AFF A700 all-flash storage system HA pair.

[NOTE]
These configurations provide a starting point for sizing guidance. Some customer environments might have multiple MEDITECH production and non-MEDITECH workloads running simultaneously, or they might have higher IOP requirements. You should work with the NetApp account team to size the storage systems based on the required IOPS, workloads, and capacity to determine the right platform to serve the workloads.
