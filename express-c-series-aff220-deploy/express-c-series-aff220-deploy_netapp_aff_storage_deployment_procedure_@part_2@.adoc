== ONTAP SAN boot storage setup

=== Create iSCSI igroups

To create igroups, complete the following step:

You need the iSCSI initiator IQNs from the server configuration for this step.

. From the cluster management node SSH connection, run the following commands. To view the three igroups created in this step, run the igroup show command.
+
....
igroup create –vserver Infra-SVM –igroup VM-Host-Infra-A –protocol iscsi –ostype vmware –initiator <<var_vm_host_infra_a_iSCSI-A_vNIC_IQN>>, <<var_vm_host_infra_a_iSCSI-B_vNIC_IQN>>
igroup create –vserver Infra-SVM –igroup VM-Host-Infra-B –protocol iscsi –ostype vmware –initiator <<var_vm_host_infra_b_iSCSI-A_vNIC_IQN>>, <<var_vm_host_infra_b_iSCSI-B_vNIC_IQN>>
....
+
[NOTE]
This step must be completed when adding additional Cisco UCS C- Series servers.

== Map boot LUNs to igroups

To map boot LUNs to igroups, run the following commands from the cluster management SSH connection:

....
lun map –vserver Infra-SVM –volume esxi_boot –lun VM-Host-Infra- A –igroup VM-Host-Infra- A –lun-id 0
lun map –vserver Infra-SVM –volume esxi_boot –lun VM-Host-Infra- B –igroup VM-Host-Infra- B –lun-id 0
....

[NOTE]
This step must be completed when adding additional Cisco UCS C-Series servers.
