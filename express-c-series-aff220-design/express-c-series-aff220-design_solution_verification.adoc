Cisco and NetApp designed and built FlexPod Express to serve as a premier infrastructure platform for their customers. Because it was designed with industry-leading components, customers can trust FlexPod Express as their infrastructure foundation. In keeping with the fundamental principles of the FlexPod portfolio, the FlexPod Express architecture was thoroughly tested by Cisco and NetApp data center architects and engineers. From redundancy and availability to each individual feature, the entire FlexPod Express architecture is validated to instill confidence in our customers and to build trust in the design process.

VMware vSphere 6.7 was verified on the FlexPod Express infrastructure components. This validation included 10GbE uplink connectivity options for the hypervisor.
